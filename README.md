## 1. Introduction 
#### Context
	
 In the contemporary world, everyone carries at least one electronic device on them at all times when they go outside. Most of the time these people do not carry a charger with them, on account of it being inconvenient, difficult to carry, or simply because of their carelessness. These can then find themselves in a pickle when they are in a public place, with a very low battery charge and no way to charge the device.
  
 Therefore, there is a need for a battery charger dispenser, so that people can charge their devices on the go and don’t have to worry about their batteries running out. We proposed, to solve it by placing vending machines at a selected number of places, where a user can borrow the power bank, and after use, he/she can return it at any of the vending machines.

#### Problem Specification

We require an android user application to allow users and admin to interact with the distributed vending machines so as to locate nearest vending machines according to their power bank availability and facilitate the borrowing and return of the power bank units.  There should be a way to store the users’ information such as user profile, power bank borrowed, time for which a power bank is borrowed by the respective user, money owed, calculated according to the business model, in real-time.

## 7. Steps 
#### Follow the following steps in order the run the application on Expo-Go : 

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to CSL2060_SE_Project using cd command
3. Run npm install (a local host would start running on your system, having a QR code at the bottom left corner)    
4. Run npm install react-native-safe-area-context
5. If above two steps yield any permission error, try sudo before the commands. If there is further error, try using expo instead of npm
6. Find the Vending Machine QR codes for scanning in the Images folder above.
7. Download Expo Go app from the play store
8. Scan the QR Code on the local host and enjoy!
